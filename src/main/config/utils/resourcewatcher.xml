         Many resources in MMBase are 'watched' for changes.
         Every of these watched resources has its own check interval (usually hard-coded between a few seconds and a few minutes).
         The one thread which is doing all the checking, does sleep between checks too.
         It's sleep time can be configured here. During development you want it to be low, in production high to avoid the overhead.
