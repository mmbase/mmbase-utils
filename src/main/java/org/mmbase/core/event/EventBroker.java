/**
 * This is the base class for all event brokers in mmbase. the function of an
 * event broker is to know about a specific kind of event, as well as a specific
 * kind of event listener. All events should be derived from the
 * org.mmbase.core.event.Event class, and all listeners from the
 * org.mmbase.core.event.EventListener interface.<br/> Allthough event
 * listeners have to implement the EventListener interface, the actual method
 * that will be called to pass on the event is not part of this interface, as it
 * is specific for the kind of event you want to listen for. This is a contract
 * between the broker implementation and the event listerer interface.<br/>
 * This class does most of the work of keeping references to all the listeners
 * and allowing for adding/removing them. Only a fiew type specific actions are
 * delegated to the super class.<br/> The EventListener also provides a method
 * for passing on constraint properties to a event broker. If you want to create
 * your own event type you can use this feature to accomplish that not all
 * events of your type are propagated to the listener.
