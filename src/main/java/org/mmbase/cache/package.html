      The goal of this package is to centralize the MMBase
      caches. Every cache extends the abstract 'Cache' class, which
      also contains the static methods to obtain a list of al caches.
    </p>
    <p>
      All caches which are based on the Cache class can also be
      configured (activity, size) by &lt;config&gt;/caches.xml.
