 *
 * Hash Collections (HashSet, HashMap, Hashtable, etc) are typically implemented with an array of buckets.
 * Each bucket is itself an array or linked list of <key, value> pairs. To decide which keys go into
 * which buckets, the array index for the bucket is produced by taking the hash value, modulo the size
 * of the collection. That is,
 * <code>bucketIndex = abs(hashValue % tableSize);</code>
 * Within each bucket, the search for the object is sequential, and uses equals. In the ideal case, the
 * table size is a prime number, the hash values would be evenly distributed, and each bucket would
 * contain just one value. Lookup in that case is incredibly fast: just one call to hashCode and one call
 * to equals. If the hash values (modulo the table size) are constant, you have the worst case; all the
 * objects will be in one bucket, and accessing the objects will require a sequential search through every
 * single item in the hash table, calling equals for every single item. Lookup in that case will be incredibly
 * slooow!
 *
 * Requirements: synchronization with Equality
 * <code>If x.equals(y), then x.hashCode() == y.hashCode()</code>
 * That is, if two objects are equal, then their hash values are equal. Note that the reverse is not true;
 * two objects may have the same hash value but not be equal!
 *
 * Basic design goals:
 * Even Distribution
 *   An ideal implementation would return integer values that are
 *   evenly distributed over the range from zero to Integer.MAX_VALUE.
 *   That is, if I picked a million random objects, their hash values
 *   would be pretty randomly distributed over this range. In the best
 *   case, any unequal objects would have different hash values.
 * Fast
 *   An ideal implementation would compute the hash value very quickly.
 *   After all, this method is going to be called every time an object
 *   is put into a hash-based collection, and every time you query whether
 *   an object is in a hash-based collection.
 * Simple
 *   Since you should implement this for every object that could go into
 *   hash-based collections, you want your code to be simple to write and easy
 *   to maintain.
