      `Tranformers' define tranformations of Strings, byte arrays and streams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Transformers are devided in three species. CharTransformers which transform some String to
      another String (or Reader to a Writer). Then there are transformation which take a byte array
      (or an InputStream) and transform that to a String (or a Writer), these are called
      ByteToCharTransformers. And the last type are are the ByteTranformers, which tranform a byte
      array to another byte array (or an InputStream to an OutputStream).
    </p>
    <p>
      All Transformers can be specialized to 'ConfigurableTransformers'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several Abstract implemenations are present too. E.g. the 'ReaderTransformer' is nearly a
      complete CharTransformer, only the function wich pipes a Reader to a Writer is
      abstract. StringTranformer is a CharTransformer which' only abstract function is the one
      taking a String argument.
