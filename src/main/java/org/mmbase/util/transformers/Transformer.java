 * Interface for transformations. Actually, since there are so many
 * types of transformers (byte/byte, char/char, char/byte), nothing
 * can be pointed out to be typical for Transformers. This interface
 * ended up a bit emptier than I anticipated.
 *
 * A Transformer must be serializable, because it is exposed through bridge (as 'processors').
