    <p>
      Classes related to the java.util.logging package (new in java 1.4). There are two things which you may want:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Make MMBase log with java.util.logging.Logger's. This is possible with the 'Impl' class of
        this package, which can be configured in log.xml. So, this wraps java.util.logging.Logger in
        org.mmbase.util.logging.Logger.
      </li>
      <li>
        You have some class which asks for a java.util.logging.Logger where it will log to, and you
        want it to log to the MMBase log. For this, the 'MMBaseLogger' class is meant. So, this
        wraps org.mmbase.util.logging.Logger in java.util.logging.Logger.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <!-- version of package description $Id$ -->
    @since   MMBase-1.8
