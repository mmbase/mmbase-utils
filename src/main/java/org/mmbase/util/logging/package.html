      The MMBase logging infrastructure. The main classes of this
      package are `Logger', which provides the interface for logging
      implementations (because the precise implementation is
      pluggable), and 'Logging', which takes care of the configuration
      and setting up of the logging system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another import class is 'Level' which describes the possible
      logging levels currently known by MMBase.
    </p>
    <p>
      SimpleImpl is the most basic implementation of `Logger' but a
      more sophisticated one, based on log4j, can be found in a
      subpackage.
