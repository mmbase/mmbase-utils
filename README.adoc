MMBase Utils is a part of MMBase, but can also be used in
other projects. It contains several kind of utility
classes.

Highlights:

* An implementation of 'events'. Threads can use this to
 communicate certain things. Using mmbase-clustering,
 these events can also be sent to other servers.

* A logging framework

* A framework for string and byte array transformeration,
 plus a whole lot of implemetentations for that.

* Several java.util like classes (collections, dateparsing)

* File type recognition ('magicfile')

* The MMBase resourceloader, a generic fall-back mechanism
 for configuration files and similar resources.

* â€¦
